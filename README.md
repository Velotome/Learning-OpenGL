Learning how to use OpenGL in C++ with VScode on Linux. The aim is to build a game without using an engine one day.
Made using the LearnOpenGL book (https://learnopengl.com/), some other ressources and lot of tinkering.

# Technologies used
- OpenGL (built from source), GLAD and GLFW
- Visual Studio Code
- C++
- CMake for the build system and library linking
